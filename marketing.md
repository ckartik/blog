2. Make every attempt to even out their customers’ benefits and costs
3. Concentrate on building relationships with customers
   marketers share info about customers and competitors that has been collected through customer relationship management, and integrate it across the firm’s various departments

* used car sales – buyer wants lowest price, seller wants highest price, likely won’t do business again
