# Systems Security for Medical Systems

###### The information here is a collection of my personal notes and notes taken for 6.858 Computer Systems Security at MIT.



Too often, the general public takes information security lightly, this is in part due to the in-effective systems in place. This creates the trade-off between having ease of access vs security in regards to personal information. This may be ok non-confidential data, however for more sensitive data it's always worthwhile to use two-factor authentication.

This set of notes will mostly pertain to the more sensitive medical data and ways to keep that data secure.

From a 3000 ft view of these notes, we will deal with 3 main ideas when designing secure medical information systems.
