# Hi, my name is Kartik!

I founded a company on 2017, and we call ourselves PComm!

Our mission is to bridge the gap that exists between pharmaceutical companies access to the right patients for clinical trials, and a patients access to the right trials for them.

I have outlined some of the business concepts I've learned along the way, and some of the cool technologies I've learned along the way!

Cheers
